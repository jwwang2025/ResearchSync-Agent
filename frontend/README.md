## Frontend

This directory is reserved for the future ResearchSync web or desktop frontend.

Recommended structure (to be created when needed):

- `src/` - application source code
- `public/` - static assets
- `package.json` / `pyproject.toml` - frontend dependencies and scripts

Currently, the application is executed via the Python CLI in `researchsync_backend.cli.main`.
